A chess engine using CNN's + MCTS

I'm trying to build a policy + value head network

### Random Thoughts

1) Train DNN on dataset
2) Use DNN to get value and policy outputs
3) Select the best moves and do MCTS on those nodes

- should we encode en passant, promotion and draw by moves?
- will a 5x5 kernel affect the performance of the network? (ig it does cause the chess board is too small(8x8 tensor represenation) 
  and convolving a 5x5 kernel over the image kinda loses the information)
